# egyptFWD-Project1-DataAnalysis
In this project within egypt FWD Data Analysis Professional program from Udacity, I aim to perform some data analysis processes in python for the BikeShare company data to improve their profits and performance in the company through some investigations in this real life data/situation for gaining hands-on experience in data analysis using python and it's essential libraries.
I depended on **streamlit API** to generate a GUI for interaction with the user to present my efforts in the project, you too have the ability to see this project demo working on [my linked profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kareemad-10): in the timeline of my past posts you can see my uploaded video about this project demo.
